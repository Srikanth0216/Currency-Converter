# Currency Converter

This is a simple currency converter web application developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an external currency conversion API.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<Srikanth0216>/currency-converter.git
Obtain an API Key:

You will need an API key from a currency conversion service to provide live exchange rates. Popular options include:

Open Exchange Rates
Currencylayer
Fixer.io
Follow the instructions on the chosen service's website to obtain your API key.

Configure the API Key:

Create a file named .env in the project root directory (not committed to version control). Add a line in the following format, replacing YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key:

API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
Install dependencies (optional):

While not strictly necessary, you may consider using a package manager like npm or yarn to manage any external JavaScript libraries used in the project. Refer to the project's code for specific requirements.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Functionality
The currency converter allows you to:

Select two currencies from a dropdown menu.
Enter an amount in the source currency.
See the converted amount displayed in the target currency.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the content of the web page.
CSS: For styling the user interface elements.
JavaScript: For implementing the user interaction, fetching currency exchange rates from the API, and performing the conversion calculation.
External Currency Conversion API: To retrieve real-time exchange rates.
Note: Specific API integration instructions will depend on the chosen currency conversion service. You may need to modify the JavaScript code to handle the API's request format and response structure.
